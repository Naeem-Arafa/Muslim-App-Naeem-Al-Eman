## Development Focus

This app was developed with a primary focus on backend logic and important concepts, rather than on the API or GUI aspects. The goal was to improve programming skills and enhance religious life through clean, maintainable code.

## Inspiration

The app simulates the functionality of the Taqwa app, with differences either by addition or subtraction. It is intended for personal use and does not compete with any other application.
